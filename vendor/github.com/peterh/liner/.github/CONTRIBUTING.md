#### Liner is a scratch-your-own-itch project

While I try my best to fix any bugs encountered in liner, I do not have
sufficient time to implement feature requests on your behalf.

If you are opening a feature request, you are implicitly volunteering to
implement that feature. Obvious feature requests should be made via a pull
request. Complex feature requests will be interpreted as a
request-for-comments, and will be closed once comments are given.

#### Liner must remain backwards compatible

The API of Liner must not change in an incompatible way. When making
changes to liner, please use the [Go 1 Compatibility Promise](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat)
as a guideline.
